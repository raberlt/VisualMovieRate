From birth, doctors warn that his life will be overshadowed by limitations. Ben yearns for an ordinary life free from the harsh scrutiny he faces daily.  However, each experience of adversity, including relentless bullying and a series of painful surgeries, ignites a fire within him. Wrestling becomes his proving ground, a place where he learns to transform his facial difference into a source of power. Determined to succeed, he pushes himself relentlessly, breaking through physical, social, and even romantic barriers that once seemed insurmountable. But as unexpected challenges arise and ridicule resurfaces, Ben finds himself at a defining crossroads: fade into the background of a “normal” life, or fully embrace his unique path and boldly stand out.",

Creative treatment of the archives presents them as living texts—photos and video are layered, inverted, and interpolated to bring them new meaning and texture. Angelo Madsen’s sophomore feature is supplemented by seamlessly interwoven personal accounts to craft an portrayal that is loving yet not afraid of critique, embracing both the joy of self-discovery as well as the complex spirituality Musafar came to represent. Through his life and work, the film gives rise to profound questions of bodily autonomy and the body’s relationship to our sense of self.",

The tensions of the past still loom large in these young Muslims’ lives, and their Olympic dreams are stunted by a lack of state support despite the efforts of their dedicated coach. Director Ryan Sidhoo takes a longitudinal approach in his directorial debut, intimately capturing the boys’ journey as they reckon with growing up under the shadow of the past. A deeply affecting coming-of-age underdog story, The Track is an ode to the power of hope, friendship, and chasing your dreams against all odds.",

These Magdalene women and the children of the Mother & Baby Homes might still be shrouded in secrecy and shame, if not for the work of Justice For Magdalenes. This tiny group of women lawyers, academics and volunteers have together waged an extraordinary battle on behalf of the survivors of Irish institutions. This documentary tells their story.",

But this dazzling entertainer image should not obscure the fact that Kelly, as a staunch supporter of the American civil rights movement, also saw dancing as a political statement.",

With a soundtrack that ranges from haunting to chaotic, Getting High is both a personal reflection on the consequences of indulgence and a universal commentary on the noise and beauty of modern existence.

Over 35 years later, the filmmaker reflects on the state of this democracy through a warm-hearted family portrait set against the backdrop of the country’s recent history. Using a personal and intimate cinematic style, Arum examines her father's adherence to conventionality as a high-ranking civil servant and her mother's fervent enthusiasm as a feminist activist. In the midst of these two contrasting dynamics, Arum seeks to discover her own role and how she can contribute to social change.",

Using my family's camcorder, I animated my toys frame by frame in stop motion, disguised my friends as Ewoks and stormtroopers, and edited on a VHS video recorder (which was the top device at the time!).  It was such an amateur endeavor, but everything I loved about making films was already there… It was the place where I felt free, passionate and alive, and able to fully express myself. It’s after I made this little film that I knew that I wanted to be a director...  Today as I am nominated for Best Director,  I can’t help but remember this little film...

Yet, even within their central territories, some areas refused to bow to the Genghisids. Kozelsk was one of them. The Mongolian armies bypassed the high walls of this small town, considering that \"the skin of the wolf was not worth the risk of encountering its teeth\".However, one of the Khan’s commanders harbored a grudge against the town's citizens. Now, the people of Kozelsk must face a battle against the strongest army in the world, with no hope of victory. This is a story about people facing their death. Some try to escape, others are willing to do anything to survive, but most are prepared to protect their city from the relentless storms of the Mongolian hordes.",

Many elements of the story will be told through dramatizations, in style of early 2000s music videos, using mixed media such as stop motion, 2d animation as well as shooting on mini dv and film. The overall tone should be uplifting, championing forging your own path and sometimes the only way too get something done is say fuck it and do it yourself.",

Arrested by Iranian morality police for allegedly wearing an incorrect headscarf, Amini died in custody just three days later, sparking international outrage and solidarity. The protests have reached as far as Germany, where Iranian exiles who escaped the Iranian regime in the 1970s took to the streets side by side with young second-generation German-Iranians such as Jasmin Shakeri, Pegah Ferydoni, Natalie Amiri and Enissa Amani. Together they are fighting for a free future in which Iranian society can also live without fear and in dignity.",

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.  What led to that first groundbreaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874.",

Only on this condition did they agree to temporarily release him from the punishment cell for his last meeting with Lina. The spouses spend the precious three days allotted to them and feel happy in the most inappropriate circumstances. Osorgin says goodbye to Lina on the pier. When the ship becomes a dot on the horizon, the guards escort George back to the punishment cell, where he carefully dresses for his final journey.",

Central to this new body of work are questions about what society chooses to memorialise and how we do so.",

A dark world in which even official AfD party representatives flood TikTok with massive amounts of content and in which their right-wing extremist and anti-constitutional messages reach millions of young people. The AfD has understood how to use the time that young people statistically spend on TikTok per day for their indoctrination. And that could have fatal consequences.",

Ridley Scott forever shakes up the cinematic landscape by plunging the audience into anguish with his oppressive universe and his iconic monster. The documentary looks back at the lasting impact of this masterpiece, exploring Scott’s audacity and the genesis of his unique aesthetic. In the claustrophobic corridors of the Nostromo spaceship, the heroine played by Sigourney Weaver, becomes the first strong female figure to redefine the conventions of the genre, far from the clichés of the time.

Some of the NAACP leaders are familiar, including W.E.B. Du Bois and Thurgood Marshall, but Walter White, head of the NAACP from 1929 to 1955, has been all but forgotten. With his blond hair and blue eyes, Walter White looked white; he described himself as “an enigma, a Black man occupying a white body.”  Like virtually all light-skinned African Americans of his day, White was descended from enslaved Black women and powerful white men. But he was Black — by law, identity, and conviction and spent his entire life fighting for Black civil rights.  Forgotten Hero: Walter White and the NAACP traces the life of this neglected civil rights hero and seeks to explain his disappearance from our history.",

A note from the past echoes a hard truth: “Someone’s unwillingness to understand will always outweigh your effort.”  In A Symphony of Unfinished Selves, the narrative shifts inward, revealing the protagonist’s fractured identity. Trapped in a metaphorical room built from illusions and contradictions, he reflects on his dual persona—the social facade and the hidden, lost self. The film questions how we see ourselves versus how others see us and whether true self-recognition is possible.  Through minimalist dialogue and layered symbolism, the film captures the silent tension between who we are, who we appear to be, and who we long to become.",

The other, driven by curiosity, discovers the notebook and sets out on a journey to trace the stories it holds.  Through its pages, a haunting reminder echoes:  “If the whole world forget, never forget.  If the whole world forgive, never forgive.  Gone, but never forgotten.”  As their paths unknowingly cross in shared spaces, both must confront whether to remain anchored in their histories or let go and move forward.  A poetic exploration of memory, loss, and renewal, “If We Ever Forgot” asks: can we ever truly leave the past behind?",

What sets this work apart from Wu's previous films is that it was not conceived as a project first, leading to a film; instead, it emerged organically from the filmmaker's life working in the village—farming and raising poultry—during which time he had attached to his body a miniature camera. This process prioritized living and farming first, followed by documentation, and ultimately resulted in an 18-hour film which follows the chronological order of occurrences and documentation, and is structured into five chapters: “June,” “July,” “August,” “September,” and “October.” Screened online over 5 consecutive Fridays from January 31 to February 28, 2025.",

However, as the indigenous people of Sindh, both Muslim and Hindu Sindhis shared a rich and unique cultural heritage, blending Hindu, Islamic, Persian, and Greek influences in their traditions, language, and even religious practices. This distinct identity often left Hindu Sindhis feeling out of place in independent India.  Amid rising nationalism and growing divisions, this film seeks to document the fading yet remarkable culture of the Sindhi people. Through intimate interviews with members of a large Sindhi family now living in Japan, America, and Singapore, it explores questions of identity, belonging, and how both their adopted homelands and their Sindhi heritage continue to evolve and coexist.",

And while Duc tries to find a balance between his German-Vietnamese heritage and the expectations of others, Trúc Lâm accepts the help of a ghost to find her way back into her world.",

As the voice moves through decaying structures, it reflects on human impermanence and defiance of time. Vignettes of past lives illustrate universal human experiences. The film concludes by pondering existence, consciousness, and humanity’s drive to create meaning amidst an indifferent universe, challenging viewers to reflect on their own place in time and memory.",

However, many are unaware that Stan Lee purposely set out to repudiate God's goodness and diminish His power. Lee not only sought to paint God as an inept and uncaring being but, driven by his own infamous ego, sought to exalt himself and his plethora of comic gods and superheroes above God. Did Stan Lee have a dark and nefarious agenda? Did Stan Lee seek to distort God into a bumbling creator unworthy of worship? Did Stan Lee and Marvel Comics portray Satan as the real hero or savior of humanity? Journey with us as we discover more troubling insights in Part 3 of Marvel and DC's War on God series to discover how one of comic's most prolific creative leaders, as well as his well-known associates Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, continues to indoctrinate and perpetuate Satanic lies to hundreds of millions of young people among his unsuspecting fans.",

From 2019 to 2023, director Au Cheuk-man followed the non-profit organisation Paws Guardian on their harrowing missions to rescue and rehome stray animals – many of whom were abandoned, abused, or tortured. The result is a heartrending collection of stories on survival and resilience, highlighting the brutal realities faced by stray animals: of the 40 stray dogs featured in this documentary, only four ultimately found new homes.",

Yet, today humans and the bears find themselves caught in an uneasy truce, a hostility over territory that doesn’t bode well for either species. Niazul Hassan Khan is a young wildlife scholar, a local who has known displacement from a troubled home too. He has returned to his community in Drass, Kargil to understand the Brown Bear, and broker peace between the animals and his people. As climate change hastens the glacial melt, and shortens winters, wreaking havoc on mountain communities, Niaz and his guide trek through the mountains searching for answers and a lasting possibility of survival for the land, its people, and the bear.",

The film blends insights from biology, psychology, anthropology and philosophy into a meditation on extinction, loneliness and the fragility of life on Earth. Through the rhinos’ decline we bear witness to the consequences of human exceptionalism and hubris and to the alarming material outcomes of our relentless industrial expansion.",

Lena finds an unexpected companion in Leon. Despite their differences and seemingly opposite worlds, a deep connection forms between them—one that will bind them until death. In his new film, Germinal Roaux, one of the most unique voices of contemporary European cinema, delivers a philosophical story about aging and the decay of the body. Above all, it’s about solidarity and the small gestures of love that give meaning—and dignity—to our existence. True to the aesthetic codes established in his previous works, Roaux’s film, shot in black and white and unfolding with a ritualistic rhythm that mirrors the slow passage of time at the twilight of life, speaks poetically and with genuine emotion about the most essential bond that connects us: love.",

Here, an unsentimental turning away from the world makes for a light-footed turn towards cinema. A film that sits somewhere between meditation, transformation and dance formation.",
